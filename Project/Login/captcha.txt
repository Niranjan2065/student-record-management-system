I'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to add CAPTCHA to your website. CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart." Here's how to implement it:

1. Choose a CAPTCHA service:
   - Google reCAPTCHA
   - hCaptcha
   - Friendly Captcha
   - Custom solution

2. Sign up for the chosen service:
   For this example, let's use Google reCAPTCHA:
   - Go to the Google reCAPTCHA admin console
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Register your website by providing the domain name

3. Get your API keys:
   - After registration, you'll receive a Site Key and a Secret Key
   - Keep these keys secure; you'll need them for implementation

4. Add the CAPTCHA to your HTML:
   - Insert the following script in the <head> section of your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
   ```

   - Add the CAPTCHA widget where you want it to appear (usually in a form):

   ```html
   <form action="?" method="POST">
     <!-- Other form fields -->
     <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY"></div>
     <input type="submit" value="Submit">
   </form>
   ```

5. Verify the CAPTCHA response on the server-side:
   - When the form is submitted, verify the CAPTCHA response
   - Use your server-side language (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) to make a request to the reCAPTCHA API

   Here's a Python example using the `requests` library:

   ```python
   import requests

   def verify_captcha(captcha_response):
       secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
       verify_url = "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify"
       data = {
           "secret": secret_key,
           "response": captcha_response
       }
       response = requests.post(verify_url, data=data)
       result = response.json()
       return result["success"]

   # Use this function when processing form submission
   ```

6. Handle the verification result:
   - If the CAPTCHA is verified successfully, process the form submission
   - If verification fails, show an error message and ask the user to try again

7. Test thoroughly:
   - Test your implementation in various browsers and devices
   - Ensure it works correctly in both development and production environments

8. Implement accessibility features:
   - Provide alternative CAPTCHA methods for users with disabilities
   - Consider audio CAPTCHAs or simple math questions as alternatives

9. Stay updated:
   - Keep your CAPTCHA implementation up to date
   - Regularly check for new versions or security updates from your CAPTCHA provider

Remember to replace "YOUR_SITE_KEY" and "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" with the actual keys provided by your CAPTCHA service.
